Systems Analysis and Design

    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
    The client was a company that specializes in drivers education. The system they wanted to design was a management system to facilitate parts of the education. Specifically, the desired system was to streamline booking appointments with trainers and offer different learning packages for different desired levels of training.
    
    What did you do particularly well?
    I think I was particularly good at documenting references. For each assignment that I did research on, I would create a list of various sources and key points that I found interesting or relevant. I used this list to compile the assignment, then deleted the sources that I ended up not using.
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    I would revise the business requirements portion. I think I could have explored more in-depth and added more specitivity to the requirements
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    The use-case diagram helped organize my thoughts about what the user needs to accomplish. The activity diagrams helped visualize the step-by-step process the users will go through when interacting with the system. It is important to consider the users' needs because knowing your audience is key to being a successful business. If you do not cater to your users' needs, they will simply go elsewhere.
    
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Prior to this class, my approach to designing software was a bit of a tangled mess and difficult to follow for others. This is mostly because I've only participated in software development teams a few times--I've often worked alone. The subject material presented in this class will be very useful for designing software in a team, especially with communication with my future team mates. I also think process and object models will be a useful way to break projects down into manageble parts and plan to do implement these in the future.
